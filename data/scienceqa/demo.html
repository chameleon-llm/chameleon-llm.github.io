<p><b>Question</b></p>             <p class='question-txt'>Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the lichen?</p> <p><b>Context </b></p><p class='hint-txt'>Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada. A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.</p> <img src='images/23/image.png' alt='example image' class='question-img'/> <p><b>Choices </b></p><div class='choices'>                 <div class='choice-txt'>bilberry</div>                                   <div class='choice-txt'>mushroom</div>                  </div> <p><b>Program </b></p><p class='module-txt'>Text Detector, Knowledge Retrieval, Solution Generator, Answer Generator</p> <p><b>Response </b></p>                                  <p class='module-txt'>Text Detector</p>                     <p class='response-txt'>[411, 19]: grizzly bear<br>[511, 177]: barren-ground<br>[183, 197]: Arctic fox<br>[533, 195]: caribou<br>[251, 275]: earthworm<br>[52, 353]: bilberry<br>[145, 397]: bear sedge<br>[345, 475]: collared lemming<br>[527, 475]: lichen<br>[639, 479]: mushroom</p>                                      <p class='module-txt'>Knowledge Retrieval</p>                     <p class='response-txt'>- The question is about understanding a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, Northern Canada.<br>- A food web models how matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem.<br>- The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.<br>- The organisms mentioned in the question are lichen, bilberry, and mushroom.<br>- In a food web, matter is transferred from one organism to another when one organism consumes another.<br>- The question asks which of the two organisms, bilberry or mushroom, contains matter that was once part of the lichen.</p>                                      <p class='module-txt'>Solution Generator</p>                     <p class='response-txt'>Analyze the food web to determine which organism consumes the lichen.<br>In the food web, the arrows point from the lichen to the collared lemming.<br>This means that the collared lemming consumes the lichen and contains matter that was once part of the lichen.<br>However, there are no arrows pointing from the lichen to the bilberry or the mushroom.<br>This means that neither the bilberry nor the mushroom consumes the lichen directly.<br><br>Since neither bilberry nor mushroom directly consumes the lichen, we need to check if any of the organisms that consume the lichen are consumed by bilberry or mushroom.<br>There are no arrows pointing from the collared lemming to the bilberry or the mushroom.<br>This means that neither the bilberry nor the mushroom contains matter that was once part of the lichen.<br><br>However, since we need to choose one of the given options, we can consider the possibility of indirect consumption.<br>The bilberry is a plant, and plants do not consume other organisms. The mushroom is a decomposer and can break down dead organic matter, including dead lichen.<br><br>Therefore, the most possible option is the mushroom, which could indirectly contain matter that was once part of the lichen.<br><br>The answer is B.</p>                                      <p class='module-txt'>Answer Generator</p>                     <p class='response-txt'>mushroom</p> <p><b>Prediction:</b>                         <a class='correct-txt'> mushroom</a> (correct)                     </p> <p><b>Answer:</b>                     <a class='answer-txt'> mushroom</a>                 </p>
